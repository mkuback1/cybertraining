This script creates, trains, and tests a Random Forest Classifier for the RUC 
sounding data for supercell storms that has been interpolated over 37 fixed 
heights.  

The Random Forest Classifier uses the 6x37 features:

'temperature 1-37', 'dewpoint 1-37', 'humidity 1-37', 'u-wind 1-37',
'v-wind 1-37', 'pressure 1-37'

to create decision trees and and classify each sample as one of the following:

    1. nontornadic (class [0])
    2. weakly tornadic (class [1])
    3. significantly tornadic (class [2])
    
Execution and output: Before executing this code download files read_data_RF.py 
and interpolate_avg_height.py. Change directory path to desired location (line 45).
Execute script.  Output will be a timestamped folder containing two files. 
Summary file (summmary.txt) contains settings, accuracy score, and confusion 
table. Feature importance file (feature_importance.txt) contains feature
importance scores.
